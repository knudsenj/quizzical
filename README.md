# What is this?

This is a project suggested by the Scrimba course [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). 
The base project is to create an application that requests 5 questions 
from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
and arranges them in a quiz.  The user can submit the quiz that will
identify correct and incorrect responses and tally their results.

The figma for the project can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App). 
Additionally, the API used in this project comes from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
